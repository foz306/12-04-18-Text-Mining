# Text and Sentiment Analysis Using Python and R

Code for the [Pittsburgh Machine Learners Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Machine-Learners/events/249144503/) on April 12th, 2018.

I presented this project to the Pittsburh Machine Learners Meetup group.  Using Python, I scraped reviews of a pressure cooker sold on Amazon.  These were labeled as either positive (4 or 5 stars) and negative (1,2, or 3 starts).  I then used R to analyze the text.  I concluded that positive reviewers enjoyed the variety of recipes that could be made with the pressure cooker while the negative reviewers were frustrated by the limited warranty.
